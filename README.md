# BlacHole-MasiveSun 
#### Introdution
In this project we will simulate the effect of accretion, accretion is the aggregation of matter to a body. For example, the accretion of mass by a star is the addition of mass to the star from interstellar matter or another star.


we will apply the accretion effect to a supermassive black hole that will drain the matter from the most giant star seen by the human, this star will be orbiting the black hole with some acceleration.

#### methodology

- first we import matplotlip and math in addition to adding copyright
